# Team-2-MICB-475-2026



### Agenda for Feb 3 Meeting 


Decide on a research question
HIV Dataset
Healthy vs HIV patient. In HIV infected persons, IL6 is chronically elevated. IL6 is known to play a key role in regulation of the microbiome. Thus, investigating differences in microbiome by IL6 levels can inform issues on comorbidities. 5 aims: 
QIIME -> process HIV dataset
Everything on project 2 must be done on our shared container. 
We MUST process the dataset prior to proposal submission (Feb 22)
Filter out visits. 
They asked patients to come in 3 times, but only 2 and 3 did they collect fecal samples. These are technical replicates, we don’t want them in there: some patients are represented twice, others once.
FILTER FOR ONLY VISIT 2 
IL6 vs HIV status (pos/neg) comparision
alpha diversity metrics (run all of them)
Keep IL6 a continuous variable. 
IL6 vs some kind of alpha diversity. 
Hopefully, IL6 levels are positively correlated with diversity. 
pearsons
Not longitudinal, just correlation
1 graph of Alpha diversity vs IL-6 in HIV+, another graph of alpha diversity vs IL-6 in HIV- (can be same graph dif colours)
Beta diversity
Based on the outcome of Alpha diversity. Depending on which one has correlation this depends on which one we do. If it flattens out, maybe there’s a threshold where it doesn’t matter
Bin IL6 levels into High Medium Low
Once binned… (WEEK 6 modules)
If faith significant, do a core microbiome indicates taxa analysis. 
Shows how many microbiomes unique to each other
Shows taxa which are unique to a given condition
If shannon significant, do a DESEQ analysis
Means theres changes in abundance of microbes,
If None of 4 significant
Functional analysis using piecrust2
Optional module. 
This predicts the functional profile of our groups: what microbial pathways are upregulated and downregulated? 


Meeting notes
Evelyn will send group server credentials tomorrow morning. 



Pre-meeting notes
Do we want to use Zotero on our google docs? Yes please
I made a document for the group lit review. When we are doing our lit review, please take notes on the team proposal document ‘lit review tab’  and upload a pdf of the document on the lit review folder. 
Please change the name of the paper on the pdf name
Please group it in the appropriate sub-category folder
Team proposal is due FEB 22 Midnight (18 days from today)



Action Items…
Begin literature review, using the documentation system described above
Download dataset from server and process data by X
