# Team-2-MICB-475-2026



### Agenda for Feb 3 Meeting 

Decide on a research question
Kevin’s rough proposal:
Use the MS dataset

Are there differences in the microbiome based on medication types received during the course of MS treatment? 
Justification: Gut brain axis linked to cognitive functions and mood disorders, microbiome linked to metabolic health, inflammation. Thus, microbiome impacts of MS treatments have implications for comorbitidies of MS, and should be used to inform MS treatment strategies/
Hypothesis: The types of drugs used to treat MS in this dataset revolve around disruption of the immune system (MS is an autoimmune disease), even in some therapies it focuses on depletion of certain cell types. Therefore, we should expect differences in microbiomes depending on the mechanism of the drug. 

- Medication types: 
  - Immunomodulators
      - Interferon
      - Glatiramer acetate
      - Dimethyl Fumarate
  - Immune cell trafficking inhibitors
      - Natalizumab
      - Fingolimod
  - B-cell depleting therapy
      - OCrevus/Rituxan

- Control:
    - Considering that the patients have a paired, non-MS partner, we can use this as a control as to a ‘normal’ microbiome; controlling for environmental factors. 
    - We cannot use this to account for MS disease effects on the microbiome
    - Compare MS patients to untreated
    - There are many untreated patients ~179, as opposed to a minimum of 22 patients for a drug, so there are plenty of untreated patients to control for MS specific microbiome effects.


Meeting notes
We chose X as our final project idea


Pre-meeting notes
Do we want to use Zotero on our google docs? 
I made a document for the group lit review. When we are doing our lit review, please take notes on the team proposal document ‘lit review tab’  and upload a pdf of the document on the lit review folder. 
Please change the name of the paper on the pdf name
Please group it in the appropriate sub-category folder
Team proposal is due FEB 22 Midnight (18 days from today)



Action Items…
Begin literature review, using the documentation system described above
Download dataset from server and process data by X
